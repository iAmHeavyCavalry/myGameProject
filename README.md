# Psycho

Psycho is a game based on my experience and difficult times
I had at the Psychiatry. It was here where I am learning
coding, specially with Java and wanted to test my skills by
adding the challenge of completing a game. My intentions
are to complete this game as a mark down to my real life
situation and I hope that by completing it I also kind of
aswel complete my therapy.
